# About

This is a collection of data that has been gathered and content that has been created for a soalr tracking project for ENG100 at Irvine Valley College.

Our group in particular opted for a single axis mechanism that uses a pulley in conjunction with a threaded stepper motor to tilt a 100W solar panel. Based on our target consumer and effort:benefit analysis a dual axis system is too complex to maintain and implement.
